    <h4 style="color:DarkViolet;">Some Upsetting Facts</h4> <!-- This is Heading4. -->
      <p style="border:3px solid SlateBlue;"><i>Roughly a third of the food produced worldwide never gets eaten. About one in every nine
      people in the world suffers from chronic hunger. In the United States, where that number is
      significantly lower, some 11.1 percent (14.3 million) of U.S. households still struggled to put food
      on the table for a portion of year 2018, according to the USDA. Moreover, every year, 22 million
      pounds of food go to waste on college campuses according to estimates by the Food Recovery Network.</i></p> <!-- This is a paragraph. -->
    <h4 style="color:DarkViolet;">About NYU FREEdge</h4> <!-- This is Heading4. -->
      <p style="border:3px solid SlateBlue;"><i>Since 2016, Design for America of NYU (DFA NYU), a student organization aiming to tackle
      social challenges through human-centered design, has developed NYU FREEdge, a community
      fridge aiming to reduce food waste and food insecurity by sharing leftovers and extra food. In fall
      2019 after a year “off”, with the support of the Design Lab @ NYU MakerSpace, we successfully
      revived the FREEdge, located outside of the MakerSpace. While the FREEdge was used by
      many, much work is still needed to clarify its mission and the way to use it as well as grow a
      community of supporters to help take care of the FREEdge.</i></p> <!-- This is a paragraph. -->
      <p style="border:3px solid SlateBlue;"><i>This fall we will iterate our design based on the insights we gathered last year while exploring
      how we could use this model to help local communities around NYU campuses. Indeed, in
      spring 2020, during the lockdown, as many people lost their jobs,
      <a href="https://www.eater.com/2020/6/17/21291849/community-fridges-food-insecurity-coronavirus-covid-19-impact" target="_blank">several community fridges popped up in NYC</a>
      showing the value of a community fridge model, and we are looking to expand our impact on local communities.</i></p> <!-- This is a paragraph. -->
    <h4 style="color:DarkViolet;">Looking for New Members!</h4> <!-- This is Heading4. -->
      <p style="border:3px solid SlateBlue;"><i>Several of our team members have graduated and we are looking for new members to join our
      team. Students from all majors and schools, undergraduates and graduates, are welcome as
      long as they have an interest in the topic and human-centered design. All our team meetings will
      be virtual. For those who are in NY, there will be opportunities for doing some research and
      prototyping (keeping in mind all safety rules).</i></p> <!-- This is a paragraph. -->
      <p style="border:3px solid SlateBlue;"><i>Expectations are:<br>
      ● Willingness to learn Human-Centered Design and tackle the problem with this approach<br>
      ● A time commitment of 5 hours per week (for research, synthesis, prototyping, user feedback, and team meetings)<br>
      ● Participation in our Virtual Design Jam, on 9/19/20 from 1 pm to 5 pm<br></i></p> <!-- This is a paragraph. -->
